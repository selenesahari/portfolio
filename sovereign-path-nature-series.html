    <h1>The Sovereign Path: A Visual Rewilding</h1>
    
    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: -0.5rem;">
      Submitted to the <strong>2025 SUGi x NAVA Photography Contest</strong> under the theme: <em>Rewilding attitudes and ways we connect to Nature</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      These three photographs—<strong>Liberation</strong>, <strong>Mosaic Grace</strong>, and <strong>Shadow & Silk</strong>—were submitted to the 2025 SUGi x NAVA Photography Contest under the theme of <em>rewilding</em>. But rather than documenting wilderness, this series reframes rewilding as an internal return: to presence, authorship, and elemental connection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether set in the dunes of Morocco, among ancient mosaic courtyards, or beside a cobalt sea wall, each portrait becomes a study in sovereignty—where fashion meets nature, and gesture becomes signal.

          Liberation is both landscape and posture. In the golden desert light, she dissolves into the moment — arms raised not in surrender, but signal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Backstory:</strong> This photo was taken at the edge of the Sahara during a quiet sunrise. I had walked barefoot into the dunes and, in a spontaneous gesture, opened my arms to the wind. The stillness, the light, the silence — everything felt like a return. Not to nature, but to myself.

          Draped in red before a mosaic of memory, she is both pattern and contrast. Style becomes ceremony — rooted, radiant, and utterly intentional.
        </p>
        <p>

          <strong>Backstory:</strong> I had just stepped into this tiled courtyard when the light hit perfectly. These mosaics felt ancient and alive — like a quiet conversation with time. I wrapped my scarf, not for modesty, but in reverence. The silence of the space asked for presence. It felt like wearing a spell.

          Bold in scarlet, poised against ocean blue — where presence is not performance but power. A quiet defiance beneath coastal light.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Backstory:</strong> This was taken near the ocean, in a sunlit coastal lookout. The wind had just caught the fabric of my dress. I wasn’t posing for anyone — I was grounding myself, letting the sea and color meet in silence. There was no plan. Only instinct and clarity.
