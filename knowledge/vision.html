  <h1>DreamWeaver AI – Nobel Vision Statement</h1>

  <p>We build tools not to make the world faster,<br>
  but to make it deeper.</p>

  <p>DreamWeaver AI exists to help people see what they have been trained to rush past:<br>
  the patterns in their own thinking,<br>
  the stories that hold them back,<br>
  and the visions that can set them free.</p>

  <p>Our aim is not more noise.<br>
  It is clarity.</p>

  <p>We believe that a single moment of true awareness<br>
  can change the course of a life more than a thousand predictions.</p>

  <p>This is not technology for distraction.<br>
  It is technology for sovereignty.</p>
