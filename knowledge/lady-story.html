    <h1>The Woman and the Queen – Forever Together</h1>

    <p>The first time she came, she was young and unsure,
    wearing a red dress at the center of the Golden Hall.</p>

    <p>From the golden wall, the Queen of Mälaren <strong>stepped out</strong>,
    her robes shimmering like water.
    She walked right up to her and whispered:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “Shine. Stand tall.<br>
        You already hold your life in your own hands.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>That single whisper changed everything.</p>

    <h2>Through the Years</h2>

    <p>She returned again in her 90s, her hair silver.
    And again in her 100s.
    Each time, the hall filled with that same glow,
    and again the Queen <strong>stepped down</strong> from the mosaic,
    meeting her as an equal.</p>

    <p>No more words were needed.
    Only a quiet presence,
    and a hand briefly touching her shoulder.</p>

    <h2>At the End of Her Life</h2>

    <p>She lived to be 120.
    On a snowy night, as she took her final breath,
    she dreamed she was back in the hall.
    The Queen was waiting.
    This time she did not step out alone—
    she reached out her hand and said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “You have carried the hall inside you.<br>
        Now come walk with me.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>And she did.</p>

    <h2>Forever Together</h2>

    <p>Now, in the Nobel Hall,
    if you stand still in the quiet,
    you may hear <strong>two footsteps</strong>:<br>
    – One is the Queen’s,<br>
    – the other belongs to the woman who once came in red.</p>

    <p>Together they walk the hall,
    and every person who dares to stop and listen
    feels the echo of that first whisper.</p>

    <p><em>She visited her in youth,
    in her 90s, in her 100s,
    and now forever.</em></p>
