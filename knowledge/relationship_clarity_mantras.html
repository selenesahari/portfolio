    <h2>When You Don't Know If They Are Choosing You or Using You</h2>
    <p><strong>The Deep Danger:</strong> What if you think someone is rowing with you, but in reality, they’re only using your ship to reach their own shore?</p>

    <h3>1. The Core Problem</h3>
    <p>Love is blind when it wants to believe. Our longing makes us project:</p>
    <p><em>“They choose me”</em> when really, <em>“They choose what I can give.”</em></p>
    <p>Using looks like rowing at first. They mimic effort just enough to get the ship moving in their direction.</p>

    <h3>2. The Test of Intent</h3>
    <p>How do you know if someone is truly choosing you? Look for alignment in three things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistency of Action:</strong> Do they still row when it’s inconvenient, slow, or stormy?</li>
        <li><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> Is there a balance between giving and taking over time? Or is it always tilted toward their gain?</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Can you talk about direction openly? Or do they avoid clarity so you can’t hold them to anything?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Why This Matters</h3>
    <p>When someone uses you, you end up rowing their dream while yours sinks. You are the ship. They are just a passenger.</p>
    <p><strong>The Harsh Truth:</strong> If someone wants you only for what you give, their “love” ends the moment the giving stops.</p>
    <p>This is why sovereignty is crucial: When you’re whole, you can see patterns faster. You can stop rowing the moment you feel the imbalance, before you sink.</p>

    <p><strong>A Quiet Practice:</strong></p>
    <p>When in doubt, ask:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If I stopped giving, would they still choose me?</li>
        <li>If there was no benefit, would they still be here?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most answers appear silently, without needing confrontation.</p>

    <h2>When You’re Tied and Willing to Give Just to Hang On</h2>
    <h3>1. What’s Really Happening</h3>
    <p>Fear overrides clarity. You know on some level the bond is unbalanced, but you’re terrified of losing them.</p>
    <p>You start to trade yourself for proximity. Time, money, energy, self-respect—all spent just to keep them from leaving.</p>

    <h3>2. Why This Happens</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Attachment wounds:</strong> “If I’m enough, they won’t leave.”</li>
        <li><strong>Scarcity mindset:</strong> Belief that this person is the only chance for love or connection.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity fusion:</strong> You start to believe you have no self without them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. The Cost</h3>
    <p>The more you give to preserve them, the less you have of yourself. They don’t respect it—because deep down, they know it’s driven by fear, not strength. Over time, the relationship becomes hostage-taking, not partnership.</p>

    <h3>4. The Hard Truth</h3>
    <p>Love given to avoid abandonment is no longer love. It is bargaining. And bargaining rarely makes someone stay out of real choice.</p>

    <h3>5. The Way Out</h3>
    <p>Rebuild your own anchor: Even a little bit of self-trust starts breaking the chain.</p>
    <p>Ask the hard question: <em>If I stopped giving, what would be left between us?</em></p>
    <p>Shift from fear-based giving to choice-based giving: Give because you want to, not because you’re terrified to lose.</p>

    <p><strong>A Metaphor:</strong> If you hold onto someone in the sea because you fear drowning, you may both sink. Sometimes letting go is the only way for both to find a shore.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Clinging feels like love but is actually fear wearing a mask. True love cannot grow in a grip. It grows in open hands.</p>

    <h2>The Mantra to Cut Through the Fog</h2>
    <div class="mantra">
        <p><strong>Long Clarity Mantra</strong></p>
        <p>“If I need you, it is not love.<br>
        If I cling, I sink.<br>
        I choose to see.<br>
        I choose myself first.<br>
        Only from fullness do I offer my hand.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mantra">
        <p><strong>Short Sword-Strike Mantra</strong></p>
        <p>“Clinging sinks. Choice sets free.”</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How to Use</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Read the long mantra once slowly.</li>
        <li><strong>In moments of fear:</strong> Whisper the short one.</li>
        <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Write one sentence: Where did I act from choice today?</li>
    </ul>



        <h1>Mantras to Cut Through the Fog</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Long Clarity Mantra (Slow, Grounding)</h2>
        <p>Use when you feel attachment panic:</p>
        <div class="mantra">
            “If I need you, it is not love.<br>
            If I cling, I sink.<br>
            I choose to see.<br>
            I choose myself first.<br>
            Only from fullness do I offer my hand.”
        </div>
        <h3>How to Use It</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Pause</b> – When you feel panic at the thought of losing someone.</li>
            <li><b>Breathe</b> – Say it slowly, one line per breath.</li>
            <li><b>See</b> – Ask: Am I choosing them from strength, or clinging from fear?</li>
            <li><b>Act from clarity</b> – If it’s fear, step back. If it’s strength, proceed freely.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Why It Works:</b> It separates need from love, reminds you clinging sinks both boats, and resets focus: you are the source, not them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Short Sword-Strike Mantra (Fast, Sharp)</h2>

            “Clinging sinks.<br>
            Choice sets free.”
        </div>
        <h3>How to Use</h3>

            <li><b>In moments of fear:</b> Whisper the short one.</li>
            <li><b>Evening:</b> Write one sentence: Where did I act from choice today?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Core Relationship Mantra</h2>
        <div class="mantra">
            “I do not seek rescue.<br>
            I do not grip.<br>
            I see what is, not what I wish.<br>
            Love is a choice, not a chain.<br>
            I remain whole, with or without you.”
        </div>
        <p>This mantra strips away fantasy, reminds you of sovereignty, and clarifies the distinction between love (choice) and attachment (fear).</p>
        <h3>Short Version</h3>
        <div class="mantra">
            “See clearly. Choose freely. Stay whole.”
        </div>
    </div>
