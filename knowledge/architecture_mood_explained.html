    <h1>Key Takeaways: Feeling = Mood in Architecture</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spaces create emotions</strong> – Architecture is designed to make you <em>feel</em> something, not just to look pretty.</li>
        <li><strong>Feelings are partly universal</strong> – Most people feel similar emotions in a well-designed space (awe in a cathedral, calm in a cozy lounge).</li>
        <li><strong>But reactions are also personal</strong> – Your memories, culture, and state of mind add an individual layer to how you experience a space.</li>
        <li><strong>Design tools shape mood</strong> – <strong>Form</strong> (shape and proportions), <strong>Light</strong> (brightness, shadows, direction), <strong>Materials</strong> (stone, glass, wood) all work together to influence feelings.</li>
        <li><strong>Good architecture is intentional</strong> – Architects plan the mood as carefully as the structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is “Mood” in Architecture?</h2>
    <p>
        In architecture, <strong>mood</strong> means the <em>emotional atmosphere you experience when you are inside or around a building</em>.
        It’s not just about decoration—it’s about how the space affects your body and mind.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples of Mood in Different Spaces</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grand Cathedral:</strong> Awe, reverence, calm – created by tall ceilings, dim light, and echoing sound.</li>
        <li><strong>Museum Atrium:</strong> Curiosity, openness, energy – created by bright light, open spaces, and clear pathways.</li>
        <li><strong>Cozy Lounge:</strong> Relaxation, intimacy, safety – created by warm light, soft materials, low ceilings, and comfortable seating.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Moods Architects Aim to Create</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Awe:</strong> Large scale, soaring heights, dramatic light (e.g., cathedrals).</li>
        <li><strong>Serenity:</strong> Minimal design, soft natural light (e.g., Japanese temples).</li>
        <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Open plans, bright spaces, dynamic lines (e.g., modern museum lobbies).</li>
        <li><strong>Intimacy:</strong> Low ceilings, warm tones, enclosed spaces (e.g., cozy cafés or lounges).</li>
        <li><strong>Playfulness:</strong> Colorful materials, unexpected shapes (e.g., children’s museums or creative workspaces).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Form + Light + Materials → Mood (What you feel)</p>
