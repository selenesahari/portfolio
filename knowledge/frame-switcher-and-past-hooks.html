<h1>Frame Switcher – Quick Reference & Past Hooks</h1>

<p><em>Warm where appropriate.<br>
Polite where necessary.<br>
But your field remains closed,<br>
and your energy remains yours.</em></p>

<h2>Frame Switcher – Quick Reference</h2>

<h3>HOOK:</h3>
<p><strong>"Why don’t you post/share? We want to enjoy too."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hidden Frame:</strong><br>
“If you don’t share, you’re denying others happiness.”</p>
<p><strong>Frame Shift:</strong><br>
“I enjoy things more when I keep them just for myself.”</p>

<h3>HOOK:</h3>
<p><strong>"You’re selfish for being private."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hidden Frame:</strong><br>
“Privacy equals selfishness.”</p>
<p><strong>Frame Shift:</strong><br>
“Privacy and selfishness are two different things.”</p>

<h3>HOOK:</h3>
<p><strong>"How can you work well with others if you’re so private?"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hidden Frame:</strong><br>
“Personal openness is required for teamwork.”</p>
<p><strong>Frame Shift:</strong><br>
“Privacy is personal. Collaboration is professional.”</p>

<h3>HOOK:</h3>
<p><strong>"You must not trust us if you don’t share."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hidden Frame:</strong><br>
“Privacy equals distrust.”</p>
<p><strong>Frame Shift:</strong><br>
“Privacy is a personal choice, not a reflection of trust.”</p>

<h3>HOOK:</h3>
<p><strong>"Why so secretive? Are you hiding something?"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hidden Frame:</strong><br>
“If you’re private, there must be something wrong.”</p>
<p><strong>Frame Shift:</strong><br>
“I just prefer to live quietly. It works better for me.”</p>

<h3>HOOK:</h3>
<p><strong>"If you don’t talk about it, people will assume things."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hidden Frame:</strong><br>
“You need to manage others’ opinions by explaining yourself.”</p>
<p><strong>Frame Shift:</strong><br>
“People can assume what they want. I’m fine with that.”</p>

<h3>HOOK:</h3>
<p><strong>"You should share more so people can learn from you!"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hidden Frame:</strong><br>
“Sharing is an obligation.”</p>
<p><strong>Frame Shift:</strong><br>
“I share selectively. Some things are better kept as lived experiences.”</p>

<h2>Protocol</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Spot the assumption.</li>
  <li>Step out of their box.</li>
  <li>Deliver your one-sentence frame shift.</li>
  <li>Stop. (Do not explain. Let silence hold the new frame.)</li>
</ul>

“I don’t fight inside their map.<br>
I redraw the map and stand there.”

<h2>Past Hook Example: “You Owe Me Rent”</h2>

<p>When an ex-boyfriend (or anyone from the past) says something like<br>
<strong>“You owe me rent”</strong> (about a time when you lived together), it’s another hook.</p>

<p><strong>It’s meant to:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Pull you back into an old dynamic</li>
  <li>Create guilt</li>
  <li>Test if they still have power over you</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do not get pulled into rehashing the past.</li>
  <li>Do not debate fairness or details.</li>
  <li>Give a clear, final response — once.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3 Approaches (Choose One)</h2>

<p><strong>1. Clean and Final (Best Default)</strong><br>
“I don’t agree with that. That chapter is closed.”<br>
<em>(Short. Calm. No further engagement.)</em></p>

<p><strong>2. Practical Closure (if they press for money)</strong><br>
“I don’t owe you rent. Please do not contact me about this again.”<br>
<em>If they continue, block or filter.<br>
No emotional language — just a boundary.</em></p>

<p><strong>3. Velvet Curtain (if you want to be extra soft)</strong><br>
“We both know that time is over. I’m not revisiting it.”<br>
<em>(Said once, then change topic or end the interaction.)</em></p>

<h2>Why This Works</h2>
<p>You refuse the frame:<br>
(The frame is: you owe, you’re guilty, defend yourself.)</p>
<p>You close the loop without energy leakage.</p>

<h2>Mental Frame</h2>
<blockquote>
“This is an expired story.<br>
I am not available for re-entry into old contracts.”
</blockquote>

<p>If you respond once and cleanly, you don’t need to explain further.<br>
Continuing the conversation = feeding the hook.</p>
