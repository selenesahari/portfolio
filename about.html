        This emblem fuses the <em>bear’s resilience</em>, the <em>lion’s sovereign power</em>, and the <em>eagle’s elevated vision</em> —

    <h1>About Selene Sahari</h1>

    <p>
      Selene Sahari is an interdisciplinary creator whose work weaves together systems architecture,
      <strong>Sovereign Systems Psychology™</strong>, and visual storytelling.
      Raised on the campus of the China Academy of Art, she absorbed a visual language shaped by structure, symbolism,
      and spatial rhythm — foundations that continue to inform her work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her portfolio moves across continents and disciplines — from software engineering and AI ethics
      to photographic narratives grounded in presence, silence, and symbolic refusal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through <strong>DreamWeaver AI</strong>, she builds tools for inner clarity — designing systems not only for
      enterprises but for the inner world. Her current project, <em>The Sovereign Path</em>, is both a visual journey
      and an evolving theory of authorship beyond visibility.
