    <h1>Spark to Flame</h1>

    <h2 class="gold-underline">Mantras to Anchor the Feelings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“This feeling is me, not them.”</strong> – Whenever a spark of attraction or admiration happens, recognize it’s your own vitality waking up, not something they own.</li>
      <li><strong>“Nothing shakes me—I stand in my own axis.”</strong> – A fast, one-line reset that cuts through fog, anxiety, or longing.</li>
      <li><strong>“I savor the spark, but I am the flame.”</strong> – Keeps the good high-energy state but reminds you the source is within.</li>
      <li><strong>“People come, people go—their absence is freedom, not loss.”</strong> – Detaches you from others’ presence or absence.</li>
      <li><strong>“I am the pillar; the wind passes, but I do not move.”</strong> – A visualization mantra (paired with the marble courtyard image).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="gold-underline">How to Capture the Feelings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pause when the spark happens:</strong> Instead of running with fantasy, freeze the moment. Feel the warmth in your body, name it, and tell yourself: “This is me, I’m keeping this.”</li>
      <li><strong>Anchor with breath or touch:</strong> Place your hand on your chest or make a small circle with your fingers. Link the feeling to a slow, deep breath.</li>
      <li><strong>Replay and store:</strong> Later, recall the memory like a movie: see, feel, pause at the peak. Breathe in and imagine storing it as a golden flame in your chest.</li>
      <li><strong>Recreate on demand:</strong> Play a song, stand tall, recall the image of yourself being “seen.” With practice, the brain no longer needs the external trigger.</li>
      <li><strong>Extract the essence:</strong> Ask: “What quality in them awakened me?” Then practice growing that quality in yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="gold-underline">The Key Shift</h2>
    <p>The feeling was never about them. They were a spark. <strong>You are the flame.</strong> Once you see this, you can recreate that “in love with life” state at will, without being hooked.</p>
