  <h1>Visual Folio: Signals of Sovereignty</h1>

  <section class="submission-description" style="padding: 2rem 1rem; max-width: 900px; margin: auto; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; color: #444;">
    <p><strong>Thresholds of Her: A Sovereign Cartography of Crossing</strong> is a curated submission to the <em>Rencontres de la Photographie Marrakech + Festival OFF Arles 2025</em>, exploring the theme of <strong>Crossings</strong>.</p>

    <p>This photographic series was created in response to the theme — mapping physical, emotional, and epistemological thresholds across gardens, deserts, snowfields, city walls, and machine corridors. It traces a sovereign arc: not to be seen, but to arrive.</p>

    <p>Spanning Morocco, France, Canada, and the United States, the work documents neither tourism nor retreat — but a movement of return. Through stance, silence, and gaze, the woman resists performance and renders the external gaze obsolete. She walks not into view, but into form. Her body becomes structure. Her presence: signal.</p>

    <p>Each frame is a threshold — not just crossed, but re-authored. <br>
    The desert becomes mirror. The snow becomes veil. The city becomes witness. <br>
    This is not a document of her crossing — it is her becoming.</p>

    <p>What began as a visual inquiry has become a cartography: <br>
    A map of how sovereignty moves through space, silence, refusal — and remains intact.</p>

    <h3>Selene in the Garden (The Pre-Crossing)</h3>
    <p class="meta">Majorelle Garden · Morocco · March 2025</p>
    <p class="quote">
Beneath the lattice of palm fronds, she emerges — a sovereign presence framed in botanical geometry. Her stance is quiet, yet declarative. This is the garden before exile, the self before rupture. The viewer is invited into a psychological crossing: from belonging to becoming. Surrounded by life cultivated and curated, she prepares to step into the wilderness of her own authorship. The floral riot is not backdrop — it is metaphor.  
*Crossing begins not at the gate, but in the breath before.*
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- 2. Mosaic Memory -->

    <h3>Mosaic Memory (Crossing into Inheritance)</h3>
    <p class="meta">Casablanca · Morocco · March 2025</p>
    <p class="quote">
      Before the Zellige wall, she stands as one stands before memory: with reverence and resistance. Her bright dress and scarf form a dialogue with the ancestral pattern, evoking the tension between origin and redefinition. This is not costume — it is negotiation. Her gaze is neither nostalgic nor defiant; it is awake.  
*Inheritance is not received — it is reauthored.*
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- 3. Threshold of Knowledge -->

    <h3>Threshold of Knowledge</h3>
    <p class="meta">Al Quaraouiyine, Fez · Morocco · March 2025</p>
    <p class="quote">
      She stands at the golden gate of the world’s oldest university, not as a seeker of permission — but as a sovereign inheritor of knowledge. The hand does not knock. It claims. In a place where scholarship began centuries before women were granted access, she redefines the threshold — not to enter history, but to author its next chapter.  
*The gate opens not to the past — but to authorship.*
    </p>

    <h3>Vastness (Crossing into Silence)</h3>
    <p class="meta">Erg Chebbi · Moroccan Sahara · March 2025</p>
    <p class="quote">
    Bathed in desert gold, her arms lifted skyward, she dances alone with the void. The dunes ripple like memory, and the sun is both witness and wound. This is where language falls away. Where performance melts into presence. No longer needing to be seen, she becomes the terrain.  
*Sovereignty is born where narrative ends.*
    </p>

    <h3>Liberation (The Reclaimed Self)</h3>
    <p class="meta">Sahara Caravan Route · Morocco · March 2025</p>
    <p class="quote">
      A caravan passes behind her — echoes of tradition, commerce, gender, migration. But she does not walk with them. She turns to face us, grounded, luminous, unapologetically alone. The desert behind her is not empty but ancestral. She has crossed through the archetypes — maiden, mother, exile — and emerged not as symbol, but as author.  
*Arrival is not a place. It is a posture.*
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- 6. Arles Ascent -->

  <div class="caption">
    <h3>Arles Ascent (Crossing into Authorship)</h3>
    <p class="meta">Old Town, Arles · France · May 2025</p>
    <p class="quote">
      On a sun-bleached street, her form elongates between Renaissance stone and modern sky. The city watches, but she does not perform. Her back is to us; her gaze moves inward. This is not retreat. This is return. Arles is not backdrop; it is a station of rebirth.  
*Authorship is not shouted. It is walked.*
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- 7. Threshold of the Unclaimed -->
<div class="photo-card" tabindex="0">

  <div class="caption">
    <h3>Threshold of the Unclaimed</h3>
    <p class="meta">Rahat · Morocco · March 2025</p>
    <p class="quote">
At the edge where land surrenders to sea, the figure leans into the wind — a gesture of becoming. The scarf unfurls like a cartographer’s draft, mapping the invisible: the tension between rooted identity and the tidal pull of possibility.  
*She is not arriving at a view — but into form.*
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- 8. Descent from the Fogline -->
<div class="photo-card" tabindex="0">

  <div class="caption">
    <h3>Descent from the Fogline</h3>
    <p class="meta">Grouse Mountain · Canada · January 2025</p>
    <p class="quote">
      In a cathedral of silence, she emerges from the snow, dressed in gold and ivory — neither pilgrim nor exile. The path behind her erased by snowfall, the path ahead undefined. Here, crossing is not movement — it is reformation.  
*Form becomes sovereign when certainty vanishes.*
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- 9. Inheritance Rewritten in Air -->
<div class="photo-card" tabindex="0">
  <img src="9_Selene_Sovereign_Path_Lyon.jpg" alt="Inheritance Rewritten in Air">
  <div class="caption">
    <h3>Inheritance Rewritten in Air</h3>
    <p class="meta">Lyon · France · May 2025</p>
    <p class="quote">
      She stands above a city of memory, the past unspooling beneath her. The translucent veil flares — a spectral palimpsest, suggesting history, myth, and womanhood in motion. This is the breath between generations, where daughters choose which ghosts to carry forward.  
*Legacy is not what you hold. It’s what you rewrite.*
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- 10. Interface -->
<div class="photo-card" tabindex="0">

  <div class="caption">
    <h3>Interface</h3>
    <p class="meta">San Jose · United States · March 2025</p>
    <p class="quote">
      In a temple of machine vision, she gestures with knowing. The boundary between human intuition and algorithmic logic dissolves. This crossing is not physical — it is epistemological. The sovereign stance reclaims authorship in an age where machines read faces but not souls.  
*Visibility is not insight. Presence is not data.*
    </p>
