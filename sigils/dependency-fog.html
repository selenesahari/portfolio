    <h1>Dependency Fog</h1>
  <h3>🧬 Variant Loops</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>False Bond Loop:</strong> A cycle where love is confused with responsibility, and presence is used as proof of worth. It often begins with compassion and ends with depletion.</li>
    <li><strong>The Guilt Bind:</strong> A self-eroding pattern where one’s highest values (care, loyalty, honor) are subtly turned against them. The sovereign sees the bind, names it, and unhooks.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Hijack:</strong> The energetic distortion that occurs when acts of kindness are reinterpreted as life support. Those who can’t carry their own weight disguise need as connection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🪬 Sovereign Reframe Mantra</h3>
  <p><em>
    “I am not the battery for someone else’s collapse.<br>
    I walk beside — not beneath.<br>
    Where there is fog, I return to breath.<br>
    Where there is guilt, I install clarity.<br>
    My peace is not theirs to borrow.”
  </em></p>

  </div>
    
  <h3>🕯️ Dependency Fog Sigil — Interpretive Elements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>⭕ The Circle:</strong> Represents containment — the sovereign boundary. You are the observer, not the absorber.</li>
    <li><strong>🔻 Downward Triangle with Vertical Line:</strong> Symbolizes truth piercing illusion. The line is your axis cutting through emotional fog.</li>
    <li><strong>🌙 The Crescent:</strong> Emotional cycles — the ability to reflect emotion without being ruled by it.</li>
    <li><strong>🌀 Spirals:</strong> Mirrored loops of guilt and obligation. Compassion vs. captivity. Stillness breaks the spin.</li>
    <li><strong>✡️ Six-Pointed Star:</strong> Balance between opposites — logic + emotion, service + self-preservation. A reminder that clarity is sacred.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>🪬 Overall Meaning:</strong><br>
  This sigil encodes the sovereign's ability to:<br>
  Witness without merging · Support without surrender · Care without being captured.<br>
  It is a visual anchor for moments when someone tries to fog your vision with flattery, crisis, or guilt.
