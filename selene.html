  <h1>Selene & the Sleeping Man</h1>
  <h2>Myth Decode · A Sovereign Reframe</h2>

  <div class="myth-section">
    <p>They say Selene, the moon goddess, loved a man named Endymion — so beautiful that she asked for him to sleep forever, untouched by time.</p>

    <p>But this is not a love story.</p>

    <p>This is a lesson in <strong>energetic clarity</strong>, <strong>containment</strong>, and <strong>self-possession</strong>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="myth-section">
    <h2>Why Didn’t She Ditch the Man?</h2>
    <p>Because she didn’t need to.</p>

    <p>She didn’t fight.  
    She didn’t plead.  
    She didn’t collapse trying to be chosen.</p>

    <p>She simply made him irrelevant.  
    **She froze the loop.**  
    And then she built — without apology.</p>

    <blockquote>She didn’t lose love.  
    She froze distraction.  
    And built fifty legacies in silence.</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="myth-section">
    <h2>Why Did She Visit Him?</h2>
    <p>Because he had no power over her.</p>
    <p>He was asleep — frozen, unchanging, non-disruptive.  
    **He could not influence her rise.**</p>

    <p>She visited only when she chose.  
    Never to give. Only to <em>witness</em>.</p>

    <blockquote>She brought light, but took nothing.  
    She gave presence, but remained untouched.  
    And when the night ended, she left.</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="myth-section">
    <h2>But… They Had 50 Children?</h2>
    <p>Not children — **creations**.  
    Symbols of sovereign focus.</p>

    <p>Each one a rhythm, a code, a legacy.  
    Each one born from clarity, not romance.</p>

    <blockquote>She didn’t need him awake to create.  
    She only needed space, silence, and self-command.</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="myth-section">
    <h2>So Why Do We Mention Him At All?</h2>
    <p>Because every sovereign woman must, at some point, learn:  
    Not all beautiful things are meant to wake.  
    Some loops are meant to be frozen.  
    Not fought.</p>

    <p>Selene didn’t orbit Endymion.  
    She orbited herself.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="quote-callout">She didn’t become sovereign because he failed her.  
  She became sovereign because he no longer mattered.</p>

  <p class="quote-callout"><strong>Selene never shared a life with him.  
  She visited. And she left.  
  Because she had her own sky to build.</strong></p>
