  <h2>🧠 SOVEREIGN LEXICON — Frequency-Based Entries</h2>

  <div class="low-frequency">
    <h2>🔻 LOW FREQUENCY</h2>
    <p><em>(Externalized, reactive, distorted, approval-seeking)</em></p>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Term</th><th>Definition</th><th>Symbolic / Mantra</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Mirror Hunger</td><td>The unconscious craving to be seen, validated, or echoed — often mistaken as love.</td><td>“When I don’t need a mirror, I become light.”</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Frequency Collapse</td><td>What happens when you abandon your signal to gain approval, love, or safety. Feels like regret, resentment, or exhaustion.</td><td>“No momentary comfort is worth distortion.”</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Permission Loop</td><td>The trapped pattern of waiting for external validation, instruction, or support — often masked as humility or politeness.</td><td>“I don’t wait to be chosen. I declare and proceed.”</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Signal Bleed</td><td>When your energy leaks through overexplaining, seeking validation, or trying to be understood.</td><td>“Containment over clarification.”</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Projection Fog</td><td>When others’ unprocessed emotions are cast onto you — creating confusion or guilt not rooted in your reality.</td><td>“I don't carry what’s not mine.”</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Energetic Bait</td><td>Manipulative signals designed to trigger emotional response — flattery, guilt, shame, or pressure masked as urgency.</td><td>“If it distorts me, I disengage.”</td></tr>

      <tr><td>Anchor Point</td><td>Your fixed internal truth — the point you return to when the world destabilizes.</td><td>Grounding stone, core root, oath ring</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Glass Mind</td><td>A clear, neutral awareness — no projection, no distortion, no grasping. Just still presence.</td><td>Crystal orb, mirror shield</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Clarity Compass</td><td>Your inner orientation system. Not based on logic or emotion, but resonance.</td><td>Tuning fork, compass, North Star</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Sovereign Script</td><td>The invisible narrative you write for your life. If you don’t author it, someone else will.</td><td>Scroll, blueprint, book of life</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Inner Throne</td><td>The seat of authorship — where aligned choices are made, regardless of external noise.</td><td>Throne, altar, command center</td></tr>
