  <h1>Sovereign Lexicon</h1>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Silence</h2>
    <p>Presence without interruption. Silence is not the absence of sound — it is the space where truth echoes without distortion.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “In silence, I hear what matters.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Stillness</h2>
    <p>The state of non-resistance. Stillness is not lack of movement — it's inner alignment where no energy is wasted on struggle or reaction.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I do not chase or grasp. I return to stillness and remember who I am.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Truth</h2>
    <p>Unfiltered reality that remains when illusion is removed. It does not need consensus — only courage to see.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “Truth doesn’t scream. It stands.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Signal</h2>
    <p>A real message from within or beyond — clear, direct, and unpolluted. It bypasses noise and conditioning.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I follow signal, not noise. My body is a transmitter of truth.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Presence</h2>
    <p>Full awareness of now. No performing, no projecting, no running. Just being.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I don’t need to say much. My presence speaks for me.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>The false self acting for approval, control, or belonging. It is the opposite of authenticity.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I release performance. I don’t audition for love.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>React</h2>
    <p>Automatic movement based on fear, habit, or conditioning. Reaction is fast — but rarely sovereign.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I don’t react. I respond — when I’m ready, from center.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Projection</h2>
    <p>What the mind throws onto others that actually belongs to you — unacknowledged fear, shame, or desire.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I reclaim what I project. What I see in others reveals me.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Illusion</h2>
    <p>A story or construct that comforts but conceals. Illusion always comes with a cost: your freedom.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “Even beautiful illusions must go. I choose what’s real.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Clarity</h2>
    <p>Inner stillness that lets you see the truth without distortion. It’s not loud — it’s luminous.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I don’t rush decisions — I wait for clarity. It always comes.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
  <h2>Loop</h2>
  <p>A repeated emotional, mental, or behavioral cycle that keeps you trapped in the past. Loops are patterns — often unconscious — driven by fear, shame, or unmet needs.</p>
  <p>They mimic movement but never lead to change. Loops keep you busy but not free.</p>
  <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I step out of the loop. I don’t repeat — I evolve.”</p>
  </div>


  <div class="term">
  <h2>Love</h2>
  <p>Not external validation or fantasy — but the frequency of self-return. Love begins as self-devotion: caring for the body, tending to the mind, protecting the spirit.</p>
  <p>True love is not found. It is *remembered* — and reclaimed within.</p>
  <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I am not seeking love. I am love remembering itself.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
  <h2>Food</h2>
  <p>Not just fuel — food is communication with the body. Every bite asks: *Am I honoring my body, or reacting to a trigger?*</p>
  <p>True nourishment responds to a clear signal: hunger, fatigue, need for vitality. Emotional eating, in contrast, is a loop — an attempt to soothe, numb, or delay truth.</p>
  <p>Food becomes sacred when chosen from clarity, not compulsion.</p>
  <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I eat to honor my body, not to silence my feelings.”</p>
</div>

  <div class="term">
  <h2>🪶 Sovereign Lexicon: SOAR (Reframed)</h2>
  <p><strong>SOAR</strong> — the sovereign path to transcend reaction and reclaim elevation.</p>

  <p><strong>🔁 Summary:</strong><br>
    <em>"In the fog, I return to stillness.<br>
    From stillness, I take ownership.<br>
    Through ownership, I sharpen awareness.<br>
    And with awareness, I rise."</em>

  <div class="term">
  <h2>🔮 Dependency Fog</h2>

  <p><strong>Dependency Fog</strong> <em>(n.)</em><br>
  A psychic haze caused by emotional entanglement with those who weaponize need.<br>
  It arises when loyalty, guilt, or identity are hijacked under the illusion of duty.<br>
  The sovereign mind learns to distinguish true care from emotional capture —
  and exits the fog by choosing peace over performance, and clarity over obligation.</p>

  <h3>🧬 Variant Loops</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>False Bond Loop:</strong> A cycle where love is confused with responsibility, and presence is used as proof of worth. It often begins with compassion and ends with depletion.</li>
    <li><strong>The Guilt Bind:</strong> A self-eroding pattern where one’s highest values (care, loyalty, honor) are subtly turned against them. The sovereign sees the bind, names it, and unhooks.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Hijack:</strong> The energetic distortion that occurs when acts of kindness are reinterpreted as life support. Those who can’t carry their own weight disguise need as connection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🪬 Sovereign Reframe Mantra</h3>
  <p><em>
    “I am not the battery for someone else’s collapse.<br>
    I walk beside — not beneath.<br>
    Where there is fog, I return to breath.<br>
    Where there is guilt, I install clarity.<br>
    My peace is not theirs to borrow.”
  </em></p>

  <h3>🕯️ Dependency Fog Sigil — Interpretive Elements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>⭕ The Circle:</strong> Represents containment — the sovereign boundary. You are the observer, not the absorber.</li>
    <li><strong>🔻 Downward Triangle with Vertical Line:</strong> Symbolizes truth piercing illusion. The line is your axis cutting through emotional fog.</li>
    <li><strong>🌙 The Crescent:</strong> Emotional cycles — the ability to reflect emotion without being ruled by it.</li>
    <li><strong>🌀 Spirals:</strong> Mirrored loops of guilt and obligation. Compassion vs. captivity. Stillness breaks the spin.</li>
    <li><strong>✡️ Six-Pointed Star:</strong> Balance between opposites — logic + emotion, service + self-preservation. A reminder that clarity is sacred.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>🪬 Overall Meaning:</strong><br>
  This sigil encodes the sovereign's ability to:<br>
  Witness without merging · Support without surrender · Care without being captured.<br>
  It is a visual anchor for moments when someone tries to fog your vision with flattery, crisis, or guilt.
