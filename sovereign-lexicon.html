  <h1>Sovereign Lexicon</h1>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Silence</h2>
    <p>Presence without interruption. Silence is not the absence of sound — it is the space where truth echoes without distortion.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “In silence, I hear what matters.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Stillness</h2>
    <p>The state of non-resistance. Stillness is not lack of movement — it's inner alignment where no energy is wasted on struggle or reaction.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I do not chase or grasp. I return to stillness and remember who I am.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Truth</h2>
    <p>Unfiltered reality that remains when illusion is removed. It does not need consensus — only courage to see.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “Truth doesn’t scream. It stands.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Signal</h2>
    <p>A real message from within or beyond — clear, direct, and unpolluted. It bypasses noise and conditioning.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I follow signal, not noise. My body is a transmitter of truth.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Presence</h2>
    <p>Full awareness of now. No performing, no projecting, no running. Just being.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I don’t need to say much. My presence speaks for me.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>The false self acting for approval, control, or belonging. It is the opposite of authenticity.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I release performance. I don’t audition for love.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>React</h2>
    <p>Automatic movement based on fear, habit, or conditioning. Reaction is fast — but rarely sovereign.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I don’t react. I respond — when I’m ready, from center.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Projection</h2>
    <p>What the mind throws onto others that actually belongs to you — unacknowledged fear, shame, or desire.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I reclaim what I project. What I see in others reveals me.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Illusion</h2>
    <p>A story or construct that comforts but conceals. Illusion always comes with a cost: your freedom.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “Even beautiful illusions must go. I choose what’s real.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
    <h2>Clarity</h2>
    <p>Inner stillness that lets you see the truth without distortion. It’s not loud — it’s luminous.</p>
    <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I don’t rush decisions — I wait for clarity. It always comes.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
  <h2>Loop</h2>
  <p>A repeated emotional, mental, or behavioral cycle that keeps you trapped in the past. Loops are patterns — often unconscious — driven by fear, shame, or unmet needs.</p>
  <p>They mimic movement but never lead to change. Loops keep you busy but not free.</p>
  <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I step out of the loop. I don’t repeat — I evolve.”</p>
  </div>


  <div class="term">
  <h2>Love</h2>
  <p>Not external validation or fantasy — but the frequency of self-return. Love begins as self-devotion: caring for the body, tending to the mind, protecting the spirit.</p>
  <p>True love is not found. It is *remembered* — and reclaimed within.</p>
  <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I am not seeking love. I am love remembering itself.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="term">
  <h2>Food</h2>
  <p>Not just fuel — food is communication with the body. Every bite asks: *Am I honoring my body, or reacting to a trigger?*</p>
  <p>True nourishment responds to a clear signal: hunger, fatigue, need for vitality. Emotional eating, in contrast, is a loop — an attempt to soothe, numb, or delay truth.</p>
  <p>Food becomes sacred when chosen from clarity, not compulsion.</p>
  <p><em>Mantra:</em> “I eat to honor my body, not to silence my feelings.”</p>
