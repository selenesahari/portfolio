  <h1>DreamWeaver AI Manifesto</h1>

  <p><strong>DreamWeaver AI</strong> is a sovereign design system for the inner world â€” where architecture, identity, and intelligence intersect. Created by Selene Sahari, it brings forth tools to reprogram perception, reclaim authorship, and restore psychological clarity.</p>

  <p>This manifesto is not a declaration of product. It is a framework for perception. Each tool exists not to fix â€” but to reveal. Not to amplify noise â€” but to return signal.</p>

  <h2>Principles</h2>
  <p>We believe:</p>
  <p>â€“ That presence is power, and clarity is sovereignty.</p>
  <p>â€“ That spectacle is a trap. True authorship is built in silence.</p>
  <p>â€“ That most systems hijack attention. Ours returns it to the source.</p>

  <h2>Core Tools</h2>
  <div class="tool">
    <h3>ðŸ§  Signal Pendant</h3>
    <p>A visual and verbal mirror that exposes borrowed language, reveals subconscious framing, and restores the voice to its sovereign state. Powered by natural language models, delivered in clarity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h3>ðŸ“– Narrative Cleanroom</h3>
    <p>An interface for rewriting emotional logic. Guided by sovereignty-based cues, the Cleanroom invites users to clear inherited scripts, design new frames, and return to authorship â€” without apology.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h3>ðŸ§­ Unshakable Field Protocol</h3>
    <p>A ritual structure for psychological fortification. Combines symbolic imagery, ambient signal, and visual anchoring to build an unbothered, untouchable interior state. Accessible. Immediate. Sovereign.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Final Note</h2>
  <p>DreamWeaver AI is not here to entertain. It is here to return you to command. You are not a follower of trends. You are the architect of meaning. This is not self-help. This is signal design.</p>

  <p>Welcome to the sovereign field.</p>

  <p><strong>Selene Sahari<br>Founder, DreamWeaver AI</strong></p>
