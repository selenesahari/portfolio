<h1>E-Charisma Guide for Online Presence</h1>

<h2>1. E-Charisma is Different from Physical Charisma</h2>
<p>Charisma that works in person doesn’t automatically translate online.</p>
<p>Online, substance and communication skills matter more because physical presence cues are limited.</p>

<h2>2. Visual Presence: Frame and Lighting</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure your face takes up about one-third of the screen and is centered.</li>
    <li>Use good lighting (desk lamp or ring light) so your face looks clear and bright.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Nonverbal Engagement</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Nod and smile to show you’re engaged instead of constant “uh-huh” vocal cues.</li>
    <li>Pull your camera back if you use hand gestures so your movements are visible.</li>
    <li>Avoid negative resting face and slouching.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Voice Control</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Invest in a good microphone for clarity.</li>
    <li>Slow down, articulate, vary pitch and tone to make speech engaging.</li>
    <li>Pause deliberately to signal others to speak.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Eye Contact</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the camera, not just the screen, especially when presenting.</li>
    <li>Position the camera at eye level to mimic real eye contact.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Interaction and Sharing the Spotlight</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Refer to previous speakers and invite input:
        <span class="examples">“I hear what you’re saying, Cheryl. What do you think, George?”</span>
    </li>
    <li>Use metaphors, rhetorical questions, and lists of three to make points memorable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Writing and Social Media Charisma</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Online communication (emails, texts, social media) is more substance-focused.</li>
    <li>Use a conversational tone, mention people by name, and comment positively on their content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Main Idea</h3>
<p>
To be charismatic online, you need to intentionally manage your visual presence,
nonverbal cues, voice, eye contact, and how you invite participation.
Substance and clarity matter more online than in person.

<h1>How to Apply Metaphors, Rhetorical Questions, and Lists of Three</h1>

<h2>1. Metaphors</h2>
<p>Metaphors create mental pictures, making your point more vivid.</p>
<div class="examples">
    “Think of this project as a marathon, not a sprint.”<br>
    “We need to be the lighthouse, not the ship in this storm.”<br>
    “This data is our compass; it points the way forward.”
</div>

<h2>2. Rhetorical Questions</h2>
<p>Rhetorical questions invite reflection and pull people in, even in a video meeting.</p>
<div class="examples">
    “What leader doesn’t want a team that trusts each other?”<br>
    “If not now, when?”<br>
    “Can we really afford to wait another quarter to fix this?”
</div>

<h2>3. Lists of Three</h2>
<p>Grouping ideas in threes is memorable and gives a rhythm to your speaking.</p>
<div class="examples">
    “We need clarity, speed, and alignment.”<br>
    “This will save time, reduce risk, and boost confidence.”<br>
    “Our next steps are simple: listen, adapt, deliver.”
</div>

<h2>How to Use Them in a Zoom Call</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Prepare one or two metaphors beforehand.</li>
    <li>Pose a rhetorical question before introducing an idea.</li>
    <li>Summarize key points as three bullets, so people can remember.</li>
</ul>
