    <ul>
        <li><b>Security & Risk Management</b> – Sets the rules: policies, risk appetite, compliance, ethics, and leadership.</li>
        <li><b>Asset Security</b> – Identifies valuable data and defines how to classify, protect, store, and destroy it.</li>
        <li><b>Security Architecture & Engineering</b> – Designs secure systems, using principles like defense-in-depth and encryption.</li>
        <li><b>Communication & Network Security</b> – Protects information as it moves across networks and systems.</li>
        <li><b>Identity & Access Management</b> – Controls who can log in and what they can do.</li>
        <li><b>Security Assessment & Testing</b> – Tests, audits, and scans to make sure defenses work as intended.</li>
        <li><b>Security Operations</b> – The day-to-day security work: monitoring, responding to incidents, backups, patching.</li>
        <li><b>Software Development Security</b> – Builds security into software from the start (secure coding, SDLC, DevSecOps).</li>
